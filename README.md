# Advent of Code

I only just discovered [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), and I have decided to attempt each of the past years, hopefully finishing before this year's puzzles are released.

I have also decided to attempt each year's puzzles in a [different programming language](./doc/languages/_index.md) -- although I'm not sure how well I'll go with that. As each year is in progress, it will exist only in that year's branch; I shall merge back into `main` when the year is complete.

Be warned that the solution to each day's puzzle will be in my commit message -- although I suspect in many cases, each person's input data is randomised, so my correct solution may not work for anyone else.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

If one thing has become clear the few times I've checked the forums for hints, it's that I am really not as familiar with common algorithms and data structures as I should be. That realisation has, of course, led me to think about developing generalised libraries for a bunch of different algorithms -- not that I would ever attempt to bite off more than I can chew in an attempt to procrastinate. Nope. Not me.

I shall save that for later, but see my [list of algorithms](./doc/algorithms/_index.md) and [list of data structures](./doc/data-structures/_index.md) for more details on my implementations of such where relevant.
