# Advent of Code

I only just discovered [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), and I have decided to attempt each of the past years, hopefully finishing before this year's puzzles are released.

I have also decided to attempt each year's puzzles in a different programming language -- although I'm not sure how well I'll go with that. As each year is in progress, it will exist only in that year's branch; I shall merge back into `main` when the year is complete.

Be warned that the solution to each day's puzzle will be in my commit message -- although I believe each person's input data is randomised, so my correct solution would probably not work for anyone else.
