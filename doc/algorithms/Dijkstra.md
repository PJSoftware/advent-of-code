# Dijkstra's Algorithm

[Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) is used to determine the shortest path between two points in a weighted [graph](../data-structures/Graph.md).

- For [2016/13](../../2016/13/README-13.md), I implemented a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm that constructed its very grid-like graph while solving it. Of course, at the time I didn't really know much about [graphs](../data-structures/Graphs.md)
