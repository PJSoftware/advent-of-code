# Graphs

[Graphs](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)>) are typically used to model shortest-path and travelling-salesman problems.

- For [2016/13](../../2016/13/README-13.md) I constructed what was essentially a graph before I knew what that data structure actually was.
- For [2016/24](../../2016/24/README-24.md) we actually need several graphs to solve the problem: the initial conversion of our maze to a graph to allow us to use [Dijkstra's algorithm](../algorithms/Dijkstra.md) to generate our second graph for use with what is essentially a travelling salesman problem.
  - Is there an easier way to solve a maze represented as an ASCII block of characters?
