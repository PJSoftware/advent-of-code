## Hello World

Generally when learning a new language, the very first piece of sample code you
run into is the ubiquitous **Hello World** program.

Since I've often found that getting local libraries/packages/modules to work --
many languages love to keep all their libraries in specific locations, or even
publish them online, so keeping it local can be tricky -- I've decided my very
first task with each of these new languages needs to be working out how to
achieve local libraries. In order to do that, for each year there will be an
`hw` folder, and a `hello` library containing a `world` subroutine.

And I'm retrospectively adding them for [Perl](./Perl.md) and [Go](./Go.md).

The approach I use may not be the _best_ approach, but all I need is for it to
work!
