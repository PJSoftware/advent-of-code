# Ruby

I struggled with [Rust](./Rust.md) for a while but have decided to abandon it,
and switch to Ruby for my [2017](../../2017/README.md) attempts.

Being an interpreted language, Rust feels more like [Perl](./Perl.md) at first
glance. Installing it in `Windows` gave me the option to install `msys` --
which, much like `Rust`'s insistence on installing `Visual Studio`, felt at
first to be a bit _aggressive_. But I already had it installed anyway so ...
sure, why not!
